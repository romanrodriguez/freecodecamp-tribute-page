          <blockquote>
            <p>From John Wheeler, I learned that with a sufficiently good intuition it is often possible to guess the solution to a difficult problem. But of more importance, I came to realize the extent to which science is a social enterprise; not one man,
              not a single group, but rather the collective effort of a community.
